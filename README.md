#Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
I've defined the key NFRs, focusing on availability, scalability, security, performance, reliability, cost optimization, maintainability, and compliance, which are critical for Zantac's multinational food and beverage business.
#Functional Requirements (FRs)
I've detailed the functional requirements for migrating Zantac's eight major applications to AWS, with infrastructure automation, proper networking, auto-scaling, load balancing, and security configurations.
#Three Migration Approaches
I've developed three distinct migration strategies:

##Approach 1: Lift and Shift with Incremental Modernization

Focuses on quick migration with minimal changes
Includes architecture diagram, README.md, and Terraform code
Provides a phased modernization roadmap


##Approach 2: Containerization and Microservices Evolution

Containerizes applications and adopts microservices architecture
Includes architecture diagram, README.md, and Terraform code for EKS/ECS setup
Details service decomposition and container orchestration


##Approach 3: Cloud-Native Serverless Architecture

Embraces serverless services like Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB
Includes architecture diagram, README.md, and Terraform code
Focuses on event-driven architecture and managed services



#Comprehensive Comparison
I've provided a detailed comparison of all three approaches, analyzing their pros and cons, implementation requirements, costs, scalability aspects, and timeline considerations.
POC Implementation
I've developed a proof-of-concept implementation as required in the case study:

Terraform code for creating the VPC, auto-scaling groups, web server, load balancer, and IAM user
Ansible configuration for changing the web server port from 80 to 8080
Jenkins pipeline for automating the deployment
Execution instructions with troubleshooting guidance

This comprehensive solution addresses all aspects of the cloud migration case study and provides Zantac with multiple well-defined migration strategies to choose from based on their specific priorities and constraints.
