# Approach 1: Lift and Shift with Incremental Modernization

## Summary
This approach focuses on migrating Zantac's applications to AWS with minimal modifications initially, followed by a phased modernization strategy. This minimizes upfront effort and risk while enabling a faster migration timeline. The infrastructure will be built using Terraform and configured with Ansible to ensure consistency and automation.

## Benefits
- **Faster Migration**: Quicker time-to-cloud with reduced initial complexity
- **Lower Initial Risk**: Maintaining existing application architectures reduces migration risks
- **Phased Modernization**: Ability to modernize applications incrementally after migration
- **Cost Predictability**: Easier to forecast initial cloud costs based on current infrastructure

## Challenges
- **Technical Debt**: Existing application limitations are carried over initially
- **Limited Cloud-Native Benefits**: Not fully leveraging AWS services from the start
- **Potential Refactoring**: May require additional work later for optimization
- **Temporary Increased Costs**: Running both legacy and modernized systems during transition

## Key Components
1. **AWS EC2 Instances**: Direct migration of existing applications to EC2
2. **Auto Scaling Groups**: Configured for each application tier
3. **Elastic Load Balancing**: For traffic distribution and high availability
4. **RDS for Oracle**: Migration of Oracle databases to managed service
5. **AWS Direct Connect**: Secure connection between on-premises and AWS
6. **Hybrid App Integration**: Maintaining connectivity with Salesforce and mobile apps
7. **Infrastructure as Code**: Using Terraform and Ansible for automation
8. **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitoring and alerting for the migrated infrastructure

## Modernization Roadmap
1. **Phase 1**: Direct migration to EC2 (months 1-3)
2. **Phase 2**: Database optimization and migration to RDS (months 4-6)
3. **Phase 3**: Application containerization for suitable workloads (months 7-12)
4. **Phase 4**: Adoption of additional AWS services for optimization (months 13-18)

## Technical Implementation
The infrastructure will be provisioned using Terraform and configured with Ansible. This ensures consistent deployment across environments and enables infrastructure versioning. A CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins will automate the deployment process.

## Migration Strategy
1. **Assessment**: Detailed inventory and dependency mapping
2. **Planning**: Migration waves based on application dependencies
3. **Implementation**: Lift and shift migration with minimal changes
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive pre and post-migration testing
5. **Optimization**: Incremental improvements after successful migration
