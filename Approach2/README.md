# Approach 2: Containerization and Microservices Evolution

## Summary
This approach focuses on containerizing Zantac's applications and adopting a microservices architecture. By leveraging container orchestration with Amazon ECS/EKS, we enable greater flexibility, scalability, and resource efficiency. The strategy includes refactoring existing monolithic applications into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

## Benefits
- **Improved Resource Utilization**: Containers use resources more efficiently than VMs
- **Deployment Consistency**: Same container runs identically across all environments
- **Independent Scaling**: Scale individual services based on their specific requirements
- **Faster Deployment**: Streamlined CI/CD pipeline with containerized deployments
- **Technology Flexibility**: Different services can use different technologies/frameworks
- **Reduced Vendor Lock-in**: Containerized applications are more portable

## Challenges
- **Increased Complexity**: Microservices architecture introduces distributed system challenges
- **Service Communication**: Need for effective service discovery and API management
- **Monitoring Overhead**: More components to monitor and troubleshoot
- **Database Refactoring**: Need to adapt database architecture for microservices
- **Team Skills**: Requires expertise in containerization and container orchestration

## Key Components
1. **Amazon EKS/ECS**: Container orchestration platform for managing containerized applications
2. **Docker Containers**: Packaged applications with all dependencies
3. **Application Load Balancer**: For routing traffic to containers
4. **Amazon ECR**: Repository for storing container images
5. **AWS App Mesh**: Service mesh for managing microservices communication
6. **Amazon RDS**: Managed database service for application data
7. **Amazon DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for specific microservices
8. **AWS CloudWatch Container Insights**: Monitoring for container environments

## Microservices Roadmap
1. **Phase 1**: Containerize existing applications (months 1-3)
2. **Phase 2**: Implement initial service mesh and communication patterns (months 4-6)
3. **Phase 3**: Refactor monolithic applications into microservices (months 7-18)
4. **Phase 4**: Implement advanced patterns like CQRS, event sourcing (months 19-24)

## Technical Implementation
The infrastructure will be provisioned using Terraform with container orchestration on Amazon EKS. Docker containers will be built and deployed through a CI/CD pipeline (Jenkins) with configuration managed by Kubernetes manifests.

## Migration Strategy
1. **Assessment**: Identify application dependencies and potential microservices boundaries
2. **Containerization**: Convert existing applications to run in containers
3. **Orchestration Setup**: Deploy EKS/ECS cluster with necessary supporting services
4. **Phased Migration**: Move applications to containers one by one
5. **Microservices Refactoring**: Gradually decompose monoliths into microservices
